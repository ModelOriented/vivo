Title: Local Variable Importance via Oscillations of Ceteris Paribus Profiles
Version: 0.1.2
Authors@R: c(person("Anna", "Kozak", email = "anna1993kozak@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre")),
            person("Przemyslaw", "Biecek", role = c("aut", "ths")))
Description: Provides an easy to calculate variable importance measure based on 
  Ceteris Paribus plot and is calculated in eight variants. We obtain eight 
  variants measure through the possible combinations of three parameters such as 
  absolute_deviation, point and density.
